# TwentyFlappyEight
Unity game combining two classics, Flappy Bird and 2048! 

I made this project in February, 2023 to get back into Unity in preparation for an upcoming game jam. I wanted to combine the 2 most classic mobile games I could think of, and I decided on Flappy Bird and 2048. I thought they would go well together as Flappy Bird can get a bit repetitive and 2048 can get so "thinky" it slows down to a crawl. The combination tickles both parts of your brain at the same time and can be a real challenge!
